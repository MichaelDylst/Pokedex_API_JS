# POKEDEX API BY MICHAEL

General layout has been made. 

## What works? 
  Search button and search field to find your beloved pokemon.  
  
  First 4 moves show up
  
  Their types show up
  
  Their image shows up

## What does not work? 
  Evolution chain - there is now a bug that always shows up the evolution of the previous search even though there is another evo or no more evo. 
  ### FIXED 
  The evolution chain now correctly shows a log that there is no evo left when there is no evo left. 
  ### NEW BUG
  Shows the log that there is no evo left when there still is an evo left `${:()}`
  
  It's only the first 4 moves that show up, which makes that there are a lot of duplicate moves like : ice punch, mega punch,...


### Evolution chain 
  #### how to access? 
  https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/4/ -> This link gets you into the pokemon species. The 4 is your pokemon ID. 

### Let's get to work!
